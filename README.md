# Justly

This is a library for “justified containers”,
inspired by the [justified-containers] library in Haskell.

Briefly, this library might help you
wherever you’re using indices instead of references.

Check out the `rustdoc` documentation for `src/lib.rs`
for the main description of Justly
and information about using it.

Also see the `meta/` directory
to learn more about the structure of this repo.
