# Revision 0

This is an experiment
with using stable revision numbers to identify commits
so that we can, as much as we like, decouple them
from their docs, tags, issues, reviews, postmortems,
hosting providers, and so on.
If you want to add metadata about an older commit,
or even if you want to refactor the structure of this metadata,
you can do so just by adding commits
which update these metadata files.

This is the initial commit,
so as usual, there’s not much to say that isn’t already covered
in the documentation comments in the library itself.
